Version 0.3.0   - ???
  * We now preserve the last-accessed and last-modified timestamps correctly
  * Fixed a bug where lockfiles were being created that were not
    world-readable
  * Made archivemail work better when used as a python module so it can
    integrate better with unittest.
  * Budled a unit testing script for archivemail.

Version 0.2.1   - 4 April 2002
  * Since we might not have a parse-able 'Date-Received' or 'Date' field,
    use 5 different ways to guess the date of a message. 
  * Removed the '--use-mtime' option since it is obsolete -- we will always
    use the file modification time for the message if other date-parsing
    methods fail.  
  * Check to see if we are running as root -- if so, change our
    effective userid and groupid to that of the original mailbox. This will 
    make sure any archives or tempfiles we write have the same ownership and 
    will allow the root user to do "archivemail /var/spool/mail/*"
  * Fixed a bug where if you ran 'archivemail.py foo/mbox' it would create 
    the archive file in the current directory instead of the directory 'foo'.

Version 0.2.0   - 3 April 2002
  * Added support for reading from MH mailboxes
  * Refuse to proceed if we would be making tempfiles in world-writable
    directories
  * Clamped down with lots of assert()s checking function parameters
  * Complain earlier if we do not have permission to write to the output
    directory
  * Use the 'Date' field of a message when constructing the 'From_' line
    from a maildir/MH mailbox if there is no 'Delivery-Date' field.

Version 0.1.0   - 31 March 2002
  * Initial release
