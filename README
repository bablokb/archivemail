archivemail - archive and compress old mail in your mailbox
-----------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:

To install archivemail, run:
    python setup.py install


USE:

archivemail is a tool written in python(1) for archiving and compressing old
email in mailboxes. 

It can move messages older than the specified number of days to a separate
'archive' mbox-format mailbox that is compressed with 'gzip'.

For example, have you been subscribing to the 'linux-kernel' mailing list
for the last 6 years and ended up with an 160-meg mailbox that 'mutt' is
taking a long time to load?  'archivemail' can move all messages that are
older than 6 months to a separate compressed mailbox, and leave you with
just the most recent messages. 

'archivemail' can save a lot of disk space and will significantly reduce
overhead on your mail reader. The number of days before mail is considered
'old' is up to you, but the default is 180 days. 

For more detailed information, look at the archivemail man page.

'archivemail' currently works on mbox, maildir and MH format mailboxes
and requires python v2.0 or greater. It also supports deleting old mail
instead of archiving it with the '--delete' option.

The best way to run archivemail is from cron. Giving the '-q' option to
archivemail will make it quiet, only printing messages if something went 
wrong. Check out the 'examples' directory for an example shell script to 
be run from cron.
