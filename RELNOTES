Subject: archivemail 0.7.1 released


Hi folks, 

archivemail 0.7.1 was released today.  This is a maintenance release with
numerous fixes.  Most notably, archivemail should now work flawlessly with
python 2.5; this was long overdue.  Again, there are quite important fixes in
the IMAP code.  And like with 0.7.0, there's one new feature (the new --copy
option, see below).  

Here are the main items from the changelog, roughly ordered by priority:

  * Fixed incompatibility with Python 2.5 which broke Maildir handling.
  * Fixed IMAP message flag conversion which was completely broken. 
  * Username and password in IMAP URLs can now be double-quoted, so it should be
    no longer a problem if they contain delimiters like the '@' character.
  * New option --copy: archive mail, but don't delete it from the mailbox.
    This is mainly useful for testing purposes, and complements --delete.
  * IMAP: if selecting the mailbox fails, archivemail detects the server's
    mailbox hierarchy delimiter, replaces slashes in the mailbox name with the
    delimiter and tries again. 
  * When converting from other formats to mbox, archivemail used to preserve
    existing 'Status' and 'X-Status' mbox headers; these are now silently
    overwritten to ensure they have correct values.
  * Invalid messages/files in Maildirs caused archivemail to silently stop
    processing mails and claim it's all done.  Now skip these and go ahead.
  * The automatic seteuid feature of archivemail is insecure and thus
    deprecated; it will be removed from later versions.
  * archivemail now accepts --days=0

UPDATE

Released v0.7.2, fixing a crash with IMAP and python << 2.5. 

Cheers,
