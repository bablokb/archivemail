1. Why doesn't archivemail support bzip2 compression in addition to gzip?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am quite happy to add bzip2 support to archivemail as soon as a 'bzip2'
module (similar to the gzip module) is available for python.  
[ Hint hint ;) ]
