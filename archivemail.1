.SH "NAME"
archivemail \- archive and compress your old email
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBarchivemail\fR\ 'u
\fBarchivemail\fR [\fBoptions\fR] {\fIMAILBOX\fR...}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
archivemail is a tool for archiving and compressing old email in mailboxes\&. By default it will read the mailbox
\fIMAILBOX\fR, moving messages that are older that the specified number of days (180 by default) to a
\fBmbox\fR(5)\-format mailbox in the same directory that is compressed with
\fBgzip\fR(1)\&. It can also just delete old email rather than archive it\&.
.PP
By default,
\fBarchivemail\fR
derives the archive filename from the mailbox name by appending an
_archive
suffix to the mailbox name\&. For example, if you run
\fBarchivemail\fR
on a mailbox called
exsouthrock, the archive will be created with the filename
exsouthrock_archive\&.gz\&. This default behavior can be overridden with command line options, choosing a custom suffix, a prefix, or a completely custom name for the archive\&.
.PP

\fBarchivemail\fR
supports reading
IMAP,
Maildir,
MH
and
mbox\-format mailboxes, but always writes
mbox\-format archives\&.
.PP
Messages that are flagged important are not archived or deleted unless explicitly requested with the
\fB\-\-include\-flagged\fR
option\&. Also,
\fBarchivemail\fR
can be configured not to archive unread mail, or to only archive messages larger than a specified size\&.
.PP
To archive an
IMAP\-format mailbox, use the format
\fIimap://username:password@server/mailbox \fR
to specify the mailbox\&.
archivemail
will expand wildcards in
IMAP
mailbox names according to
RFC
3501, which says:
\(lq The character "*" is a wildcard, and matches zero or more characters at this position\&. The character "%" is similar to "*", but it does not match a hierarchy delimiter\&.\(rq
You can omit the password from the
URL; use the
\fB\-\-pwfile\fR
option to make
\fBarchivemail\fR
read the password from a file, or alternatively just enter it upon request\&. If the
\fB\-\-pwfile\fR
option is set,
\fBarchivemail\fR
does not look for a password in the
URL, and the colon is not considered a delimiter\&. Substitute \*(Aq\fBimap\fR\*(Aq with \*(Aq\fBimaps\fR\*(Aq, and
\fBarchivemail\fR
will establish a secure
SSL
connection\&. See below for more
IMAP
peculiarities\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-d \fR\fB\fINUM\fR\fR\fB, \-\-days=\fR\fB\fINUM\fR\fR

\fB\-D \fR\fB\fIDATE\fR\fR\fB, \-\-date=\fR\fB\fIDATE\fR\fR
.RS 4
Archive messages older than
\fIDATE\fR\&.
\fIDATE\fR
can be a date string in ISO format (eg \*(Aq2002\-04\-23\*(Aq), Internet format (eg \*(Aq23 Apr 2002\*(Aq) or Internet format with full month names (eg \*(Aq23 April 2002\*(Aq)\&. Two\-digit years are not supported\&. This option is incompatible with the
\fB\-\-days\fR
option above\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o \fR\fB\fIPATH\fR\fR\fB, \-\-output\-dir=\fR\fB\fIPATH\fR\fR

Use the directory name
\fIPATH\fR

\fB\-P \fR\fB\fIFILE\fR\fR\fB, \-\-pwfile=\fR\fB\fIFILE\fR\fR
.RS 4

Prefix
\fINAME\fR
to the archive name\&.
\fINAME\fR
is expanded by the
\fBpython\fR(1)
function
time\&.strftime(), which means that you can specify special directives in
\fINAME\fR
to make an archive named after the archive cut\-off date\&. See the discussion of the
\fB\-\-suffix\fR
option for a list of valid
strftime()
directives\&. The default is not to add a prefix\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s \fR\fB\fINAME\fR\fR\fB, \-\-suffix=\fR\fB\fINAME\fR\fR
.RS 4
Use the suffix
\fINAME\fR
to create the filename used for archives\&. The default is
_archive, unless a prefix is specified\&.
.sp
Like a prefix, the suffix
\fINAME\fR
is expanded by the
\fBpython\fR(1)
function
time\&.strftime()
with the archive cut\-off date\&.
time\&.strftime()
understands the following directives:

.RE
.SH "NOTES"
.PP

\fBarchivemail\fR
requires
\fBpython\fR(1)
version 2\&.3 or later\&. When reading an
mbox\-format mailbox,
\fBarchivemail\fR
will create a lockfile with the extension
\&.lock
so that procmail will not deliver to the mailbox while it is being processed\&. It will also create an advisory lock on the mailbox using
\fBlockf\fR(2)\&. The archive is locked in the same way when it is updated\&.
\fBarchivemail\fR
will also complain and abort if a 3rd\-party modifies the mailbox while it is being read\&.
.PP

\fBarchivemail\fR
will always attempt to preserve the last\-access and last\-modify times of the input mailbox\&. Archive mailboxes are always created with a mode of
0600\&. If
\fBarchivemail\fR
finds a pre\-existing archive mailbox it will append rather than overwrite that archive\&.
\fBarchivemail\fR
will refuse to operate on mailboxes that are symbolic links\&.
.PP

\fBarchivemail\fR
attempts to find the delivery date of a message by looking for valid dates in the following headers, in order of precedence:
Delivery\-date,
Received,
Resent\-Date
and
Date\&. If it cannot find any valid date in these headers, it will use the last\-modified file timestamp on
MH
and
Maildir
format mailboxes, or the date on the
From
line on
mbox\-format mailboxes\&.
.PP
When archiving mailboxes with leading dots in the name,
archivemail
will strip the dots off the archive name, so that the resulting archive file is not hidden\&. This is not done if the
\fB\-\-prefix\fR
or
\fB\-\-archive\-name\fR
option is used\&. Should there really be mailboxes distinguished only by leading dots in the name, they will thus be archived to the same archive file by default\&.
.PP
A conversion from other formats to
\fBmbox\fR(5)
will silently overwrite existing
Status
and
X\-Status
message headers\&.
.SS "IMAP"
.PP
When
\fBarchivemail\fR
processes an
IMAP
folder, all messages in that folder will have their
\eRecent
flag unset, and they will probably not show up as \*(Aqnew\*(Aq in your user agent later on\&. There is no way around this, it\*(Aqs just how
IMAP
works\&. This does not apply, however, if you run
\fBarchivemail\fR
with the options
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
or
\fB\-\-copy\fR\&.
.PP

\fBarchivemail\fR
relies on server\-side searches to determine the messages that should be archived\&. When matching message dates,
IMAP
servers refer to server internal message dates, and these may differ from both delivery time of a message and its
Date
header\&. Also, there exist broken servers which do not implement server side searches\&.

.RS 4
.PP

\fBarchivemail\fR\*(Aqs
IMAP
URL
parser was written with the
RFC
2882 (Internet Message Format) rules for the
local\-part
of email addresses in mind\&. So, rather than enforcing an
URL\-style encoding of non\-ascii
and reserved characters, it allows to double\-quote the username and password\&. If your username or password contains the delimiter characters \*(Aq@\*(Aq or \*(Aq:\*(Aq, just quote it like this:
\fIimap://"username@bogus\&.com":"password"@imap\&.bogus\&.com/mailbox \fR\&. You can use a backslash to escape double\-quotes that are part of a quoted username or password\&. Note that quoting only a substring will not work, and be aware that your shell will probably remove unprotected quotes or backslashes\&.
.PP

\fBarchivemail\fR
tries to be smart when handling mailbox paths\&. In particular, it will automatically add an
IMAP
NAMESPACE
prefix to the mailbox path if necessary; and if you are archiving a subfolder, you can use the slash as a path separator instead of the
IMAP
server\*(Aqs internal representation\&.

If an IMAP mailbox path contains slashes, the archive filename will be derived from the basename of the mailbox\&. If the server\*(Aqs folder separator differs from the Unix slash and is used in the IMAP URL, however, the whole path will be considered the basename of the mailbox\&. E\&.g\&. the two URLs \fBimap://user@example\&.com/folder/subfolder\fR and \fBimap://user@example\&.com/folder\&.subfolder\fR will be archived in subfolder_archive\&.gz and folder\&.subfolder_archive\&.gz, respectively, although they might refer to the same IMAP mailbox\&.
.sp
\fBarchivemail\fR does not support reading MMDF or Babyl\-format mailboxes\&. In fact, it will probably think it is reading an mbox\-format mailbox and cause all sorts of problems\&.
.sp
\fBarchivemail\fR is still too slow, but if you are running from \fBcrontab\fR(5) you won\*(Aqt care\&. Archiving maildir\-format mailboxes should be a lot quicker than mbox\-format mailboxes since it is less painful for the original mailbox to be reconstructed after selective message removal\&.
