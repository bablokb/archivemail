Goals for next minor release (0.4.7):
-------------------------------------
* Think about the best way to specify the names of archives created with
  possibly an --archive-name option.
* Add more tests (see top of test_archivemail.py)
* We need some better checking to see if we are really looking at a valid
  mbox-format mailbox.

Goals for next major release (0.5.0):
-------------------------------------
* Lock any original .gz files 
  - is this necessary?
* Check for symlink attacks for tempfiles (although we don't use /var/tmp)

Longer Term goals:
------------------
* Add an option to not cut threads.
* Add MMDF mailbox support
* Add Babyl mailbox support
* Add option to archive depending on mailbox size threshold 
  - is this a good idea?
* Add option to archive depending on number of messages
  - is this a good idea?
* Test for missing compression programs 
  - is this a waste of time?
* IMAP support
  - is this outside our scope?
